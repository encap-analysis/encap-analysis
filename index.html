<p>Encapsulation is one of the basic characteristics of object-oriented programming. However, the access modifiers provided by common object-oriented languages do not help much because they only encapsulate the member references rather than the objects pointed to by them. Bad encapsulation makes object-oriented programs difficult to understand and reason about, thus concealing potential software vulnerabilities. We present in this paper the encapsulation analysis technique, which is an expression-based dataflow analysis, to statically compute the runtime memory layouts of object-oriented programs. The analysis results can help developers to master an intuitive comprehension on the code quality regarding encapsulation of classes. The experiment results on various open-source Java projects and libraries show that our approach is both effective (38.17% of the classes are reported as not fully encapsulated) and efficient (2.15 KLOC/s and 27.35 classes/s) in finding potential encapsulation problems. We also give common guidance on how to achieve better encapsulation for object-oriented programs.</p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Basic idea</h3>

<p>Poor encapsulation brings in potential bugs. The rationale contains two parts: first, the target class is poorly encapsulated and shares its inner memory with the outside through its methods; second, the outside modifies the shared memory, resulting in unintentional behaviors that are unknown and invisible to the class. Our approach deals with this problem from two perspectives:
<ul>
  <li>From the viewpoint of the classes, we identify the classes that potentially share memory with the outside, the members that are shared, and the methods are responsible.</li>
  <li>From the viewpoint of the clients, we discover how the shared memory is accessed by the outside.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>To evaluate the usefulness of our approach, we answer the following research questions:
<ul>
  <li>RQ1: How effective is encapsulation analysis?</li>
  <li>RQ2: Is encapsulation analysis efficient enough to process real-life projects?</li>
  <li>RQ3: Do the analysis results help developers understand and review code?</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The experimental results of our approach are as follows.</p>
Figure 1 lists the numbers and percentage of fully encapsulated classes, classes with GloEscape members, classes with ArgEscape members and classes with RetEscape members for the projects and libraries.

Figure 2 presents the way in which the class members of the projects and libraries are exposed to the outside.

Figure 3 shows the methods the are responsible for exposing the class members.

<p>We implement our approach as part of a Hoare-style code verification tool called Accumulator written in Java. The tool is avaliable <a href="https://github.com/encap-analysis/encap-analysis/tree/gh-pages/tool">here</a>. Note that the source code of the whole tool is not available for now, thus the source code of encapsulation analysis cannot be compiled seperately. </p>
